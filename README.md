# Final-Project
Ivy Tech Final Project

This is my Final Project for my Introduction to Software Development class at Ivy Tech Community College, in Valparaiso, Indiana.
This is now the final build of this project that I have developed for this class, but I plan to make changes further as time goes on after it is submitted for a grade.
